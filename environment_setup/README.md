# W13 Take home Notes

- Modified the original `watlab.py` code.
- Run "watlab-first-script" and complete the field case successfully.  
- Build the mesh and set the boundary conditions (`pip install seamsh`).  
- Open the .txt result in QGIS (TIN interpolation).  
- Create a video and plots of the simulation results.
